  "about-game": "[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/wishlist-gif.gif[/img]\n\n[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/challenges.png[/img]\n\nTo complete Challenge mode, craft transitional elements from given elements to reach objectives using transitional elements. Challenges will gradually increase difficulties, starting with one or two-step recipes and finishing with dozens of intermediate elements!\n\n[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/challenge-mountain-small.gif[/img]\n\n[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/sandbox.png[/img]\n\nIn sandbox mode, you can freely craft items together and maybe you can create rare items and discover everything with a little success!\nHundreds of crafting elements are available, some easy to guess, others challenging.\n\n[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/sandbox-small.gif[/img]\n\nWould you be able to craft every item? To resolve every challenge?\nOnly one way to know: begin the new apprentice of Alchemistry!\n\nNote: A Demo is available for free for you to try the game!\n\n[h2]Developer Notes[/h2]\n\nI am a solo developer working on that game for a few months in my free time. I deeply hope you will have fun and relax with this game :)\nWorking on a small and relaxing puzzle/crafting game was a dream I had for a while. I hope this game will be a new step in the direction of a full-time indie life. So thank you for your support, you help someone fulfill his dreams.\n\nThis game will be updated as long I have nice ideas I can add without redoing the game from scratch, as I did with the previous game. And even your feature ideas can be added if compatible!\n\nWe also have a discord community, if you want to join us, where you can share your opinions, questions, etc. about the game.\n\n[url=https://discord.gg/c8aARey][img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/discord.png[/img][/url]",
