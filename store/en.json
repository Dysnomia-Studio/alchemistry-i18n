To resolve every challenge ?\nOnly one way to know: begin the new apprentice of Alchemistry !\n\nNote: A Demo is available for free for you to try the game !\n\n[h2]Developer Notes[/h2]\n\nI am a solo developer working on that game for few months in my free time. I really hope you will have fun and relax with this game :) Working on a small and relaxing puzzle/crafting game was a dream I got for a while. I hope that game will be a new step in the direction of a full time indie life. So thank you for any small step you participate in to help me creating this game.\n\nThis game will be updated as long I have nice ideas I can add without redoing the game from scratch, as I did with the previous game. And even your features ideas can be added if compatible !\n\nWe also have a discord community, if you want to join us, where you can share your opinions, questions, etc. about the game.\n\n[url=https://discord.gg/c8aARey][img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/discord.png[/img][/url]",
