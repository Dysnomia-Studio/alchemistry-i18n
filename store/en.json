  "about-game": "[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/wishlist-gif.gif[/img]\n\n[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/challenges.png[/img]\n\nThrough challenges, use the given elements to craft transitional elements to reach given objective !\nChallenges will gradually increase difficulties, starting with one or two steps crafts and finishing with dozen of intermediate elements !\n\n[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/challenge-mountain-small.gif[/img]\n\n[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/sandbox.png[/img]\n\nUse sandbox mode to freely craft items together and maybe succeed to create rare items, and to discover everything !\nHundred of elements are available to craft, some are easy to guess, but the latest are not that easy ...\n\n[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/sandbox-beta-small.gif[/img]\n\nWould you be able to craft every item ? To resolve every challenge ?\nOnly one way to know: begin the new apprentice of Alchemistry !\n\nNote: A Demo is available for free for you to try the game !\n\n[h2]Developer Notes[/h2]\n\nI am a solo developer working on that game for few months in my free time. I really hope you will have fun and relax with this game :) Working on a small and relaxing puzzle/crafting game was a dream I got for a while. I hope that game will be a new step in the direction of a full time indie life. So thank you for any small step you participate in to help me creating this game.\n\nThis game will be updated as long I have nice ideas I can add without redoing the game from scratch, as I did with the previous game. And even your features ideas can be added if compatible !\n\nWe also have a discord community, if you want to join us, where you can share your opinions, questions, etc. about the game.\n\n[url=https://discord.gg/c8aARey][img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/discord.png[/img][/url]",
